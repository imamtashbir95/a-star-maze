# ðŸš€ A-Star Pathfinding Visualizer in React
This project is an interactive A (A-star) pathfinding algorithm visualizer* built with React.js. The A* algorithm is a powerful graph traversal and search algorithm used in game development, robotics, and AI to find the shortest path between two points.

## âœ¨ Features
* âœ… Real-time visualization of the A* algorithm in action
* âœ… Interactive grid: Set start, end, and obstacles dynamically
* âœ… Fast and efficient pathfinding using heuristics
* âœ… Customizable settings (grid size, speed, heuristic functions)
* âœ… Intuitive UI with smooth animations

## ðŸŽ¯ Why A*?
A* combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, making it both optimal and efficient. It prioritizes paths with the lowest cost, ensuring an intelligent route to the destination.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ React.js â€“ UI framework for rendering components
ðŸ”¹ HTML & CSS â€“ Custom styling for a clean layout
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript â€“ Algorithm implementation and logic

## ðŸš€ Try It Out

```
git clone https://github.com/imamtashbir95/a-star-maze.git
cd a-star-maze
npm install
npm run dev
```
